# Weswit JavaScript logging toolkit #

This library exposes a set of logger facilities that can be used to write a logging-library-agnostic code:
using the LoggerManager class the code will be able to flush its log even if no logging library is available.
Then, implementing the Logger and LoggerProvider interfaces it is potentially possible to wrap any 3rd party logging library
making it easy to switch from one library to another. The LoggerProvider can also be specified at runtime.
A ready made simple implementation SimpleLoggerProvider is already provided with this library.
This library relies on the [Weswit JavaScript toolkit](https://github.com/weswit/utility-toolkit-javascript)
